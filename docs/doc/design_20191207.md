# Design
## Component
   - Component is a holder of model + template + action
   - Not all 3 pieces are required
   - Do we need a global component like redux practice?

## Template ( View )
   - Event on view will pipe to action/message only
   - Some secret contracts are required between DOM Event and action input

## Action
   - Action is the atom component for state change
   - All 'message' needs to process in the same level component
   - If pass to parent is required, need to define an explicit action
   - Action itself dosen't trigger the view update but the post assignment to model does.

## Model
   - Allow local definition as constant
   - Model can be defined outside by model attribute
   - Allow init action to load data in sync/async
     - Can be a performance improvement point here
   - Cross model update should not be supported since it is hard to trace

## Import
   - Top-level import can import another component
   - They will be put under scope by component name - you can reuse them in your context by `view: ${view1.view}`

# Scratch
## Goal
* Performance
* Easy to define and change
* Easy to debug

## Concept
* As usability, we need an easy standard practice to satisfy 80% use case.
* Behind that there should be a LL engine to support that 'easy standard'; also can help on rest 20% if needed.
* Pass-by-value design ( not really pass-by-value ) will make the design much cleaner
* View related Syntax should be in View Template, View Model related syntax should be in view model definition

## FP
* FP has its credit here, easy to compose, stateless ( as DSL )
* FP is hard to performance tuning
